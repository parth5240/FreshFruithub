                            I apologize for the confusion, but as an AI language model, my
                            responses are generated based on pre-existing knowledge up until
                            September 2021. I don't have access to real-time data or an
                            extensive database of specific details about all fruits, including
                            their nutritional information or specific attributes. For
                            comprehensive and up-to-date information about various fruits,
                            including their nutritional value, health benefits, and
                            characteristics, I recommend referring to reputable sources such as
                            government health websites, nutrition databases, or scientific
                            literature. These sources will provide accurate and detailed
                            information about fruits and their properties..
